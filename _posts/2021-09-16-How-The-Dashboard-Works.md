The inflation dashboard takes an aggregation of price data from vendors, retailers, and suppliers across the globe to create a basket of up-to-date pricing info from primary sources.

This price data spans both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies alike.
The price data is then used to make calculations of inflation within a smart contract on the Ethereum network for transparency and accuracy.

The dashboard presents the information from the smart contract in a user friendly manner on this webpage.
