      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>Rising Tide Research Group is a company that hopes to make waves in the decentralized finance Industry.  Since decentralized finance has become mainstream many organizations involved with the industry have released tokens or coins on their own or other blockchains for individuals to invest in and look at as an asset. Rising Tide Research group breaks this norm like a crashing wave breaks the tide. Our organization’s goal is to not release a coin but instead become a De-FI App incubator. By creating a variety of applications that focus on utilizing de-fi currencies we hope to create an ecosystem in which tokens and coins are viewed as an asset that you use to purchase both physical and digital items; breaking from the norm of cryptocurrencies being viewed as an asset to buy goods rather than an asset that stores. In addition to being able to enable the exchange of crypto-currency for physical items. Rising Tides also hopes to be able to inherently increase the value of the exchanged goods through providing users of Rising Tides’ applications with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) through their transactions. These Non-Fungible Tokens will not only document that a transaction has been processed but will also encourage users to purchase goods through our applications and potentially provide the user a piece of memorabilia from their transaction.
